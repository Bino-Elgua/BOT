## Security Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Secure secret key management with minimum 32 character requirement
- No hardcoded credentials - all secrets use 🔑 placeholders
- Environment-based configuration with secure defaults

### 🛡️ Network Security
- **CORS Protection**: Wildcard origins disabled in production
- **Rate Limiting**: Atomic Redis-based rate limiting (100 req/min default)
- **WebSocket Security**: 16KB message size limit with graceful rejection
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers on all responses
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY  
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Content-Security-Policy: Strict policy
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### 🔒 Infrastructure Security
- **Redis Connection Pool**: Singleton pattern, max 50 connections
- **Database Security**: Connection pooling with secure configurations
- **Health Checks**: <100ms baseline latency requirement
- **Container Security**: Non-root user, multi-stage builds
- **Dependency Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- Comprehensive health check endpoints
- Rate limiting metrics and headers
- Connection pool monitoring
- Security audit logging

## Security Scanning

### Automated Security Analysis
- **Bandit**: Static security analysis for Python code
- **Safety**: Known vulnerability scanning for dependencies  
- **pip-audit**: OSV database vulnerability checking
- **CI/CD Integration**: Blocks merges on medium+ vulnerabilities

### Manual Security Reviews
Required before deploying to production:
- [ ] Redis connection pool singleton pattern confirmed
- [ ] WebSocket 16KB message size enforcement active
- [ ] Rate limiter atomic Redis operations confirmed
- [ ] `/health` endpoint <100ms response validated
- [ ] CI pipeline fails on medium+ vulnerabilities
- [ ] All 🔑 placeholders used, zero hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Branch protection prevents direct `main` commits

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Reporting Process
1. **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [Your Security Email]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for assessment and patching

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Security Update**: Within 7 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After patch is available and deployed

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use 🔑 placeholders for all sensitive configuration
- Run security scans before submitting PRs
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow secure coding practices

### For Operators
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Monitor security alerts and logs
- Keep systems updated
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Monitor rate limiting and abuse patterns

### For Production Deployment
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Enable branch protection rules
- Configure monitoring and alerting
- Regular security audits
- Backup and disaster recovery plans
- Network segmentation and firewalls

## Compliance Standards

### Security Controls Implemented
- **OWASP Top 10** mitigations
- **Input Validation**: Message size limits, rate limiting
- **Output Encoding**: Proper JSON serialization
- **Session Management**: Stateless design with secure tokens
- **Access Control**: Role-based access where applicable
- **Cryptography**: Strong secret key requirements
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage
- **Logging**: Security event logging without sensitive data
- **Data Protection**: Secure data handling practices
- **Communication Security**: HTTPS/WSS enforcement

### Regular Security Activities
- Monthly dependency updates
- Quarterly security reviews
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
